-> A simple calculator with the feature of EXPRESSION handling, that means you can input a whole expression(may contain parenthesis) at a time and get the result by clicking the "=" button.

-> The dot (.) button has not been added because of keeping the layout symetrical, but will be added soon after re-designing the layout.

-> Exceptions may occure, because they are not handled currently, exception handling feature will also be added soon In Sha Allah.
